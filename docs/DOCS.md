# Making Offline Docs

The docs are built using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org).

Once you have installed the `mkdocs` binary on the system, navigate to the root folder of the __redis-modules-redoc__ source (this will be the same directory holding the __mkdocks.yml__ file.

Run:

`mkdocs build`

You should find the HTML output in the newly created `site` directory. You can open the `index.html` locally on your desktop, as well as store the directory elsewhere.

__Note:__ _The site will work better when running through a basic local webserver like [SimpleHttpServer](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/modules-in-python/how-to-use-simplehttpserver/). Which commonly already available on any modern system.
